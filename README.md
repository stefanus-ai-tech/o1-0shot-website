Create an interactive and visually appealing roadmap for becoming an AI/ML engineer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The roadmap should be aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. Follow these requirements:
1. Structure:
   - Use HTML5 semantic tags for better structure and accessibility.
   - Create a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
2. Content:
   - Include the following main categories: Fundamentals, Mathematics, Programming, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Advanced Topics.
   - For each category, provide 3-5 sub-topics or skills to learn.
   - Each sub-topic should have a brief description (1-2 sentences) that appears when clicked or hovered over.
3. Styling:
   - Use a modern, clean design with a cohesive color scheme.
   - Implement smooth transitions and animations for a polished look.
   - Use appropriate font pairings for headings and body text.
   - Include icons or small illustrations for each main category.
4. Interactivity:
   - Make each category expandable/collapsible to show/hide sub-topics.
   - Implement a progress tracker that allows users to mark completed topics.
   - Add a search functionality to quickly find specific topics.
   - Include a "Suggested Learning Path" feature that highlights recommended topics in order.
5. Technical Requirements:
   - Use vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (no frameworks).
   - Implement the CSS using either CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout.
   - Ensure the code is well-commented and follows best practices.
   - Make sure the implementation is accessible, following WCAG guidelines.
6. Additional Features:
   - Add a dark mode toggle for user preference.
   - Implement local storage to save user progress.
   - Create a "Resources" section with links to recommended learning materials for each topic.
7. Performance:
   - Optimize the code for fast loading and smooth performance.
   - Implement lazy loading for any images or heavy content.
Please provide the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create this interactive AI/ML engineer roadmap. Ensure that the code is clean, well-organized, and ready to be used in a web environment.
